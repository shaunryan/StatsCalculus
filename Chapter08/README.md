If you are using a CLI (like the Window’s Command Prompt or Mac’s Terminal) to run the tests scripts, it will throw an error as "Implement enable_gui in a subclass", that has to do with some of the commands used in the notebooks (like %matplotlib inline). So, if you want to run the test scripts, then please use Ipython shell. The code of the exercises is best to run it on Jupyter Notebooks.
